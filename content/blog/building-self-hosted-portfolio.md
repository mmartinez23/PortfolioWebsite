# Building My Self-Hosted Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is entirely self-hosted on my Proxmox infrastructure and secured with Cloudflare Tunnel.

## The Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Proxmox VE**: Virtualization
- **LXC Containers**: Lightweight isolation
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Secure connectivity (no port forwarding!)
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: Internal routing

### Portfolio
- **Hugo**: Static site generator
- **PaperMod Theme**: Clean, fast theme
- **Nginx**: Web server

## Why Self-Host?

1. **Learning**: Real infrastructure experience
2. **Control**: Complete ownership
3. **Cost**: Minimal after initial setup
4. **Portfolio Piece**: Shows DevOps skills

## What's Next?

Building 3-5 full-stack projects to showcase here. Stay tuned!
